This project focused on identifying product and design issues contributing to low activation rates, high churn, and inefficient design workflows, and proposing strategic UX improvements to address them.

Low Fidelity Wireframe designed to solve bad UX experience of customers.

Low friction for first-time users: demo video instead of empty state

One obvious next action: Upload / Record

Upgrade is present but not disruptive

Simple navigation: oday / Previous
